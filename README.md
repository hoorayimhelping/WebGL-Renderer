#Playing With WebGL

[Check out the rotating cube](http://hoorayimhelping.github.com/WebGL-Renderer/)


I haven't committed actual development code to this repo in a long time, but every once in a while I want to see the cube I made, so I pushed a gh-pages branch.

This is very old code, written before I really understood JavaScript scoping and closures. Please to not judge.
